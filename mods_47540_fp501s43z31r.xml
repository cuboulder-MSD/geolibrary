    <mods:abstract>Shapefile Format - This data set consist of digital data describing Areas of Critical and Environmental Concern (ACEC) for Public Lands in the State of Colorado. ACECs are designated by decisions made during BLM Resource Management Planning. Existing ACECs have a Resource value tied to them. An example of these resources would be: Threatened and Endangered Plants. Other areas of concern have also been captured within this theme. When the users opens up the attribute table for this theme the user will notice ACEC follows most of names for each area. Some BLM field offices also included Research Natural Areas (RNAs) and Outstanding Natural Areas (ONAs) within their layer. The data set was compiled from the most current data collected from the BLM Colorado Field Offices. In some cases data boundaries were snapped to the BLM’s Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB). The GCDB is a statewide survey grid that the BLM bases land boundaries on. Also, in some cases within the ACECs, outer boundary land holdings other than BLM have been cut out to show these Land Patterns. In other cases, it has not. It is suggested that the user of this data also download the BLM’s most current Surface Management Agency to compare and contrast land holdings within each ACEC.To illustrate Areas of Critical and Environmental Concern (ACEC) for the State of Colorado and for BLM Resource Management Plan (RMP) analysis and decision making.Original data was located at each BLM field office in Colorado. The GIS specialist at BLM Colorado State Office (CSO) quality checked data and merged the individual layers into the Statewide layer.This data set consists of digital data describing Areas of Critical and Environmental Concern (ACEC) for Public Lands in the State of Colorado. ACECs are designated by decisions made during BLM Resource Management Planning. Existing ACECs have a Resource value tied to them.</mods:abstract>
