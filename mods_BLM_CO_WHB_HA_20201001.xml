    <mods:abstract>Shapefile Format â€“This feature class represents the spatial extent and boundaries for Wild Horse and Burro Herd Areas in BLM Colorado. The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 designated BLM's Herd Areas. These areas were designated in 1971 as the result of wild horses and/or burros being found during initial flights of them that same year. As additional surveys were done and data gathered, it was determined that some of these animals were actually on private lands and/or were private animals. These areas were not carried forward as Herd Areas. Through land-use planning, BLM evaluates each Herd Area to determine if adequate food, water, cover and space are available to sustain healthy wild horse and burro populations. When a Herd Area meets these criteria, it is designated as a Herd Management Area (HMA). HMA boundaries are available in a separate dataset.This dataset shows the boundaries for BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Herd Areas. A published revision of the Department Manuals Part 305: Departmental Science Effects, Chapter 3: Integrity of Scientific and Scholarly Activities (305 DM 3), effective December 16, 2014, is available online at http://elips.doi.gov/ELIPS/DocView.aspx?id=4056. Scholarly information considered in Departmental decision making must be robust, of the highest quality, and the result of as rigorous scientific and scholarly processes as can be achieved. Most importantly, it must be trustworthy. This policy helps us to achieve that standard (http://www.doi.gov/scientificintegrity/index.cfm)BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Herd Areas</mods:abstract>
