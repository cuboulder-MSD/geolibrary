    <mods:abstract>Shapefile Format –This data is one feature type that is a part of a set consisting of six shapefiles pertaining to energy development and production in Colorado. The set includes one shapefile for each of the following categories: communitization agreements, gas storage agreements, geophysical permits, geothermal leases, oil and gas leases, and oil and gas units. These shapefiles are generated based on tabular data drawn from BLM's LR2000 database using BLM's geospatial GCDB database as a geographic reference. The GCDB database contains continually updated cadastral information collected by BLM's staff surveyors. Dissolved versionTo identify oil and gas geophysical permits. These shapefiles are generated on a quarterly schedule to provide the public with updated graphical and attribute information regarding the energy categories listed above. Dissolved versionDescription of the Error Spreadsheet: BLM uses a Python script to automatically generate polygon shapefiles from legal land descriptions contained in LR2000 records. The script does this by looking for a polygon in BLM's GCDB database to match the LR2000 land description and then cloning or subdividing the polygon in the new shapefile. The error spreadsheet that accompanies the downloadable data contains LR2000 records which the script wasn't able to match to GCDB polygons. This typically occurs for one of two reasons. Either the LR2000 record didn't contain a valid legal land description, or the script wasn't able to find a unique polygon in the reference GCDB database to match the legal land description provided in LR2000.A published revision of the Department Manuals Part 305: Departmental Science Effects, Chapter 3: Integrity of Scientific and Scholarly Activities (305 DM 3), effective December 16, 2014, is available online at http://elips.doi.gov/ELIPS/DocView.aspx?id=4056. Scholarly information considered in Departmental decision making must be robust, of the highest quality, and the result of as rigorous scientific and scholarly processes as can be achieved. Most importantly, it must be trustworthy. This policy helps us to achieve that standard (http://www.doi.gov/scientificintegrity/index.cfm)Combining of the working interests and royalty interests of leases covering small tracts of land that cannot be independently developed into a unit of designated size sufficient for the granting of a well permit under applicable state regulatory agency spacing regulations.</mods:abstract>
